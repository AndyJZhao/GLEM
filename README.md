# LEARNING ON LARGE-SCALE TEXT-ATTRIBUTED GRAPHS VIA VARIATIONAL INFERENCE
This repository is the official implementation of **GLEM**.

## Overview
The proposed GLEM framework trains GNN and LM separately in a variational EM
framework: In E-step, an LM is trained towards predicting both the gold and GNN predicted pseudolabels; In M-step, a GNN is trained by predicting LM-inferenced pseudo-labels using the embeddings and labels predicted by LM.

## Requirements
We use the miniconda to manage the python environment. We provide the environment.yaml to implement the environment
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Training
Please look the details in Readme.md of each dataset inside the OGB folder.
